# openMINDS LinkML

Complete collection of schemas for the metadata models of the openMINDS metadata framework. All schemas are formatted in [LinkML](https://linkml.io) (*.yaml).

**Warning: these schemas are auto-generated.
In case of any discrepancy between the LinkML representation of the schemas
and the original openMINDS schema definitions,
the original openMINDS schema definitions should be considered as the correct reference.**

## Development

Contributions are welcome, please see our [contribution guidelines](https://openminds-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shared/contribution_guidelines.html).

This repository has two main branches: `pipeline` and `main`.
The `pipeline` contains the code for building the LinkML schemas from the openMINDS schema definitions.
The build process is triggered by changes to the schemas, and runs as a GitHub action.
The resultant package is copied to the `main` branch.
