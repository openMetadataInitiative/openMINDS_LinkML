  permissible_values:
    Gestalt visual stimulation:
      description: null
    abstract image visual stimulation:
      description: In an 'abstract image visual stimulation' a subject is visually
        stimulated with a static image that does not show a natural scene but reduced
        information or forms (e.g., colored symbols or outlines of faces).
    checkerboard visual stimulation:
      description: Stimulation technique that uses a checkerboard as visual stimulus.
    current step stimulation:
      description: Current step stimulation is a technique in which an amount of current
        is applied in predefined steps, whilst measuring changes in neural/muscular
        activity.
    drifting grating visual stimulation:
      description: null
    electrical stimulation:
      description: A technique used to elicit a reaction by an electrical stimulus.
    figure-ground visual stimulation:
      description: null
    microstimulation:
      description: null
    natural image visual stimulation:
      description: In a 'natural image visual stimulation' a subject is visually stimulated
        with a static image that shows a natural scene (e.g., landscape or a person).
    natural sound auditory stimulation:
      description: null
    optogenetic stimulation:
      description: Using light of a particular wavelength, 'optogenetic stimulation'
        increases or inhibits the activity of neuron populations that express (typically
        due to genetic manipulation) light-sensitive ion channels, pumps or enzymes.
    photon stimulation:
      description: null
    random dot motion stimulation:
      description: "In a 'random dot motion stimulation' a subject is visually stimulated\
        \ with a video where simulated randomly distributed dot(s) are re-positioned\
        \ at a new random location with each video frame [[Newsome & Par\xE9, 1988](https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.08-06-02201.1988)."
    single pulse electrical stimulation:
      description: A 'single pulse electrical stimulation' is a cortical stimulation
        technique typically used in the field of epilepsy surgery.
    static grating visual stimulation:
      description: null
    subliminal stimulation:
      description: '''Subliminal stimulation'' is a technique providing any sensory
        stimuli below an individual''s threshold for conscious perception (adapted
        from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli))'
    subliminal visual simulation:
      description: '''Subliminal visual simulation'' is a technique providing visual
        stimuli below an indivdual''s threshold for conscious perception [adapted
        from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli)]'
    transcranial magnetic stimulation:
      description: null
    whisker stimulation:
      description: '''Whisker stimulation'' comprises all stimulation techniques in
        which a single whisker or a group of whiskers is deflected in repeatable manner.'
