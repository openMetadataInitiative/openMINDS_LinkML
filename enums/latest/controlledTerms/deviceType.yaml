    CT scanner:
      description: A 'CT scanner' is an x-ray machine that creates and combines serial
        two-dimensional x-ray images (sections) with the aid of a computer to generate
        cross-sectional views and/or three-dimensional images of internal body structures
        (e.g., bones, blood vessels or soft tissues).
    MRI scanner:
      description: An 'MRI scanner' is a machine that uses strong magnetic fields,
        magnetic field gradients, and radio waves to generate static or time-resolved
        three-dimensional images of the anatomy and physiological processes of the
        body.
    electronic amplifier:
      description: An 'electronic amplifier' is a device that increases the power
        (voltage or current) of a time-varying signal.
    microscope:
      description: A 'microscope' is an instrument used to obtain a magnified image
        of small objects and reveal details of structures not otherwise distinguishable.
    microtome:
      description: A 'microtome' is a mechanical instrument with a steel, glass or
        diamond blade used to cut (typically) biological specimens into very thin
        segments for further treatment and ultimately microscopic or histologic examination.
    vibrating microtome:
      description: A 'vibrating microtome' is an mechanical instrument with a vibrating
        steel blade used to cut (typically) biological specimens into thin segments
        for further treatment and ultimately microscopic or histologic examination.
