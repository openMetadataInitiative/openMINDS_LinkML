    Ward clustering:
      description: '''Ward clustering'' is a general agglomerative hierarchical clustering
        procedure, where the criterion for choosing the pair of clusters to merge
        at each step is based on the optimal value of an objective function (typically
        aiming to minimize the total within-cluster variance). [adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward%27s_method)]'
