    coisogenic:
      description: '''Coisogenic'' breeding  is a type of inbreeding where the offspring
        differs at only a single locus through a mutation occurring in the original
        inbred strain.'
    congenic:
      description: '''Congenic'' breeding is the production of offspring from repeated
        backcrossing into an inbred (background) strain, with selection for a particular
        marker, ideally a single gene from another strain.'
    hybrid:
      description: A 'hybrid' is an organism that resulted from special outbreeding
        of two species (normally within the same genus).
    inbred:
      description: '''Inbred'' breeding (or inbreeding) is the production of offspring
        from mating organisms that are genetically closely related (same background
        breed).'
    outbred:
      description: '''Outbred'' breeding (or outbreeding) is the production of offspring
        from mating organisms that belong to two different background breeds.'
    selective inbred:
      description: '''Selective inbred'' breeding (or selective inbreeding) is the
        production of offspring from mating organisms that are genetically closely
        related (same background breed) and have been selected based on a particular
        phenotype.'
