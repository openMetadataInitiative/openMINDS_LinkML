    permissible_values:
      congenic:
        description: '''Congenic'' breeding is the production of offspring from repeated
          backcrossing into an inbred (background) strain, with selection for a particular
          marker, ideally a single gene from another strain.'
      hybrid:
        description: A 'hybrid' is an organism that resulted from special outbreeding
          of two species (normally within the same genus).
      coisogenic:
        description: '''Coisogenic'' breeding  is a type of inbreeding where the offspring
          differs at only a single locus through a mutation occurring in the original
          inbred strain.'
      inbred:
        description: '''Inbred'' breeding (or inbreeding) is the production of offspring
          from mating organisms that are genetically closely related (same background
          breed).'
      outbred:
        description: '''Outbred'' breeding (or outbreeding) is the production of offspring
          from mating organisms that belong to two different background breeds.'
      selective inbred:
        description: '''Selective inbred'' breeding (or selective inbreeding) is the
          production of offspring from mating organisms that are genetically closely
          related (same background breed) and have been selected based on a particular
          phenotype.'
