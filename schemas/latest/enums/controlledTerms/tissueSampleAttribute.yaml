  permissible_values:
    fixated:
      description: A specimen that was treated with a fixative (e.g., paraformaldehyde)
        to preserve its existing form and structure.
    free floating:
      description: A specimen that has been suspended in solution for further handling
        or experimental steps (e.g., immunohistochemical staining), or temporary storage
        before further use.
    labeled:
      description: A specimen that has been modified using chemical or biochemical
        substances for selective tagging of e.g., molecules or subcellular components,
        which does not necessarily leads to a visual observable colorization.
    mounted:
      description: A specimen that has been put ('mounted') on e.g., a glass slide
        with mounting medium in order to be supported for further handling and/or
        long term preservation.
    stained:
      description: A specimen that has been dyed using chemical or biochemical substances
        for general colorization of e.g., molecules or subcellular components, that
        can be visualized under the right light exposure.
    unstained:
      description: A specimen that was not artificially modified in colorization using
        chemical or biochemical substances.
    untreated:
      description: A specimen that has not been modified or treated (e.g., with chemicals)
        compared to its natural state.
