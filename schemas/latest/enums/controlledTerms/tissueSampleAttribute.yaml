    permissible_values:
      mounted:
        description: A specimen that has been put ('mounted') on e.g., a glass slide
          with mounting medium in order to be supported for further handling and/or
          long term preservation.
      labeled:
        description: A specimen that has been modified using chemical or biochemical
          substances for selective tagging of e.g., molecules or subcellular components,
          which does not necessarily leads to a visual observable colorization.
      stained:
        description: A specimen that has been dyed using chemical or biochemical substances
          for general colorization of e.g., molecules or subcellular components, that
          can be visualized under the right light exposure.
      free floating:
        description: A specimen that has been suspended in solution for further handling
          or experimental steps (e.g., immunohistochemical staining), or temporary
          storage before further use.
      fixated:
        description: A specimen that was treated with a fixative (e.g., paraformaldehyde)
          to preserve its existing form and structure.
      untreated:
        description: A specimen that has not been modified or treated (e.g., with
          chemicals) compared to its natural state.
      unstained:
        description: A specimen that was not artificially modified in colorization
          using chemical or biochemical substances.
