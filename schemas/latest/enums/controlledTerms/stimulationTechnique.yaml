    permissible_values:
      subliminal visual simulation:
        description: '''Subliminal visual simulation'' is a technique providing visual
          stimuli below an indivdual''s threshold for conscious perception [adapted
          from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli)]'
      microstimulation:
        description: null
      natural image visual stimulation:
        description: In a 'natural image visual stimulation' a subject is visually
          stimulated with a static image that shows a natural scene (e.g., landscape
          or a person).
      static grating visual stimulation:
        description: null
      electrical stimulation:
        description: A technique used to elicit a reaction by an electrical stimulus.
      figure-ground visual stimulation:
        description: null
      current step stimulation:
        description: Current step stimulation is a technique in which an amount of
          current is applied in predefined steps, whilst measuring changes in neural/muscular
          activity.
      single pulse electrical stimulation:
        description: A 'single pulse electrical stimulation' is a cortical stimulation
          technique typically used in the field of epilepsy surgery.
      whisker stimulation:
        description: '''Whisker stimulation'' comprises all stimulation techniques
          in which a single whisker or a group of whiskers is deflected in repeatable
          manner.'
      drifting grating visual stimulation:
        description: null
      natural sound auditory stimulation:
        description: null
      random dot motion stimulation:
        description: "In a 'random dot motion stimulation' a subject is visually stimulated\
          \ with a video where simulated randomly distributed dot(s) are re-positioned\
          \ at a new random location with each video frame [[Newsome & Par\xE9, 1988](https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.08-06-02201.1988)."
      optogenetic stimulation:
        description: Using light of a particular wavelength, 'optogenetic stimulation'
          increases or inhibits the activity of neuron populations that express (typically
          due to genetic manipulation) light-sensitive ion channels, pumps or enzymes.
      subliminal stimulation:
        description: '''Subliminal stimulation'' is a technique providing any sensory
          stimuli below an individual''s threshold for conscious perception (adapted
          from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli))'
      transcranial magnetic stimulation:
        description: null
      photon stimulation:
        description: null
      Gestalt visual stimulation:
        description: null
      abstract image visual stimulation:
        description: In an 'abstract image visual stimulation' a subject is visually
          stimulated with a static image that does not show a natural scene but reduced
          information or forms (e.g., colored symbols or outlines of faces).
      checkerboard visual stimulation:
        description: Stimulation technique that uses a checkerboard as visual stimulus.
