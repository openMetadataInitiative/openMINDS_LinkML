    Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic:
      description: Quantification of a distance between the empirical distribution
        function of the sample and the cumulative distribution function of the reference
        distribution, or between the empirical distribution functions of two samples.
    Kullback-Leibler divergence:
      description: A measure of how one probability distribution is different from
        a second, reference probability distribution.
    chi-squared statistic:
      description: Test statistic resulting from a chi-squared test.
    mean squared error:
      description: The mean squared difference between two series of values.
    t-statistic:
      description: The ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter
        from its hypothesized value to its standard error.
    z-score:
      description: The number of standard deviations by which an observed value is
        above or below the mean value.
