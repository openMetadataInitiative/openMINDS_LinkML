    permissible_values:
      symmetric synapse:
        description: A 'symmetric synapse' has flattened or elongated vesicles, and
          does not contain a prominent postsynaptic density. Symmetric synapses are
          typically inhibitory.
      axon terminal:
        description: The distal terminations of axons which are specialized for the
          release of neurotransmitters.
      synaptic protein:
        description: A 'synaptic protein' belongs to a family of neuron-specific phosphoric
          proteins associated with synaptic vesicles. Synaptic proteins are present
          on the surface of almost all synaptic particles and bind to the cytoskeleton.
      mitochondrion:
        description: A 'mitochondrion' is a semiautonomous, self replicating organelle
          that occurs in varying numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of virtually
          all eukaryotic cells. It is notably the site of tissue respiration (Gene
          Ontology).
      dendritic spine:
        description: A 'dendritic spine' is a protrusion from a dendrite. Spines are
          specialised subcellular compartments involved in the synaptic transmission.
      asymmetric synapse:
        description: An 'asymmetric synapse' is characterized by rounded vesicles
          in the presynaptic cell and a prominent postsynaptic density. Asymmetric
          synapses are typically excitatory.
      synaptic bouton:
        description: A 'synaptic bouton' is a terminal pre-synaptic ending of an axon
          or axon collateral.
      dendrite:
        description: A 'dendrite' is a branching protoplasmic process of a neuron
          that receives and integrates signals coming from axons of other neurons,
          and conveys the resulting signal to the body of the cell (Gene Ontology).
      nerve fiber:
        description: A threadlike extension of a nerve cell within the nervous system
          which consists of an axon and, if myelinated, a myelin sheath.
      synaptic vesicle:
        description: A 'synaptic vesicle' is a secretory organelle (~ 50 nm in diameter)
          released from the pre-synaptic nerve terminal. It accumulates high concentrations
          of neurotransmitters and secretes these into the synaptic cleft by fusion
          with the 'active zone' of the pre-synaptic plasma membrane (modified from
          Gene Ontology).
      neurofilament:
        description: A 'neurofilament' is a type of intermediate filament found in
          the core of neuronal axons. Neurofilaments are responsible for the radial
          growth of an axon and determine axonal diameter.
      nucleus:
        description: A 'nucleus' is a membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells
          that contains the chromosomes. It is the primary site of DNA replication
          and RNA synthesis in the cell (Gene Ontology)
      axon:
        description: An 'axon' is the long process of a neuron that conducts nerve
          impulses, usually away from the cell body to the terminals which are the
          site of storage and release of neurotransmitter (Gene Ontology).
      neurite:
        description: A 'neurite' is a small neuronal process on developing neurons
          that ultimately grow out into axons or dendrites under the control of growth
          stimulating or inhibiting factors from their direct extracellular environment.
