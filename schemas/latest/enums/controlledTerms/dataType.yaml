    title: Data type
    permissible_values:
      time series:
        description: A 'time series' is a list or matrix, where elements are ordered
          in equally spaced points in time.
      matrix:
        description: A 'matrix' is a list of lists.
      scalar:
        description: A 'scalar' represent a single value (e.g., integer, float, string,
          etc.).
      table:
        description: A 'table' is an arrangement of elements (scalars, lists and/or
          matrices) in specified/named rows and columns.
      voxel data:
        description: '''Voxel data'' is a matrix defining values (scalars, lists,
          or matrices) on a grid in a three dimensional space, which can be rendered
          to raster graphic.'
      associative array:
        description: A 'associative array' is an abstract data type that associates
          keys (scalars) with values (scalars, lists or matrices).
      event sequence:
        description: An 'event sequence' is a list or matrix, where elements are ordered
          in not equally spaced points in time.
      3D computer graphic:
        description: A '3D computer graphic' is an associative array, defining points,
          lines, and/or curves in a three dimensional space, which can be rendered
          to raster graphic.
      vector graphic:
        description: A 'vector graphic' is an associative array defining points, lines
          and curves which can be rendered to a raster graphic.
      list:
        description: A 'list' is a series of ordered scalars and/or lists.
      raster graphic:
        description: A 'raster graphic' is a matrix, representing values (scalars,
          lists, matrices) on a grid in a two dimensional space, viewable via a monitor,
          paper, or other display medium.
