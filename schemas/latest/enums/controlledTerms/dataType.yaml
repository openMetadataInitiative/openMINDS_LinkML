    3D computer graphic:
      description: A '3D computer graphic' is an associative array, defining points,
        lines, and/or curves in a three dimensional space, which can be rendered to
        raster graphic.
    associative array:
      description: A 'associative array' is an abstract data type that associates
        keys (scalars) with values (scalars, lists or matrices).
    event sequence:
      description: An 'event sequence' is a list or matrix, where elements are ordered
        in not equally spaced points in time.
    list:
      description: A 'list' is a series of ordered scalars and/or lists.
    matrix:
      description: A 'matrix' is a list of lists.
    raster graphic:
      description: A 'raster graphic' is a matrix, representing values (scalars, lists,
        matrices) on a grid in a two dimensional space, viewable via a monitor, paper,
        or other display medium.
    scalar:
      description: A 'scalar' represent a single value (e.g., integer, float, string,
        etc.).
    table:
      description: A 'table' is an arrangement of elements (scalars, lists and/or
        matrices) in specified/named rows and columns.
    time series:
      description: A 'time series' is a list or matrix, where elements are ordered
        in equally spaced points in time.
    vector graphic:
      description: A 'vector graphic' is an associative array defining points, lines
        and curves which can be rendered to a raster graphic.
    voxel data:
      description: '''Voxel data'' is a matrix defining values (scalars, lists, or
        matrices) on a grid in a three dimensional space, which can be rendered to
        raster graphic.'
