        agent, an electrolyte replenisher, systemic alkalizer and in topical cleansing
        solutions.
    sodium chloride:
      description: Sodium chloride commonly known as table salt, is an ionic compound
        with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride
        ions.
    sucrose:
      description: A nonreducing disaccharide composed of GLUCOSE and FRUCTOSE linked
        via their anomeric carbons. It is obtained commercially from SUGARCANE, sugar
        beet (BETA VULGARIS), and other plants and used extensively as a food and
        a sweetener.
    tungsten:
      description: Tungsten (also called wolfram) is a chemical element; it has symbol
        W and atomic number 74.
    vesicular glutamate transporter:
      description: The vesicular glutamate transporters are a subclass of glutamate
        transporters that move glutamate from the cell cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles.
    vesicular glutamate transporter 1:
      description: The vesicular glutamate transporter 1 belongs to the VGLUT family.
        It is preferentially associated with the membranes of synaptic vesicles and
        functions in glutamate transport.
    vesicular glutamate transporter 2:
      description: The vesicular glutamate transporter 2 belongs to the VGLUT family.
        It mediates the uptake of glutamate into synaptic vesicles at presynaptic
        nerve terminals of excitatory neural cells.
    vesicular glutamate transporter 3:
      description: The vesicular glutamate transporter 3 belongs to the VGLUT family.
        It transports the neurotransmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles before
        it is released into the synaptic cleft.
    water:
      description: An oxygen hydride consisting of an oxygen atom that is covalently
        bonded to two hydrogen atoms.
