    solution:
      description: A 'solution' is a special type of homogeneous mixture where at
        least one substance, called solute, is fully dissolved in another substance,
        known as a solvent. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_(chemistry))
    suspension:
      description: A 'suspension' is a heterogeneous mixture of a fluid that contains
        solid particles sufficiently large for sedimentation and may even be visible
        to the naked eye. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry))]
