      solution:
        description: A 'solution' is a special type of homogeneous mixture where at
          least one substance, called solute, is fully dissolved in another substance,
          known as a solvent. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_(chemistry))

          throughout another substance. [adapted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid)]
      suspension:
        description: A 'suspension' is a heterogeneous mixture of a fluid that contains
